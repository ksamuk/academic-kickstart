**Reproducible identification of chromosomal rearrangements**


Co-developed with [Dr. Kate Ostevik](https://www.kateostevik.com/), *syntR* is an R package for the reproducible identification of synteny blocks and chromosomal rearrangments via comparison of two genetic maps. syntR implements an error-aware clustering algorithm specifically designed for the highly linear structure of comparative genetic map data. syntR can be used to identify synteny blocks using any type of ordered genetic markers.

**Unbiased estimation of nucleotide diversity and divergence with missing data**


Co-developed with [Dr. Katharine Korunes](https://katharinekorunes.weebly.com/), *pixy* is a command-line tool for painlessly and correctly estimating average nucleotide diversity within (Ï€) and between (d<sub>xy</sub>) populations from a VCF. In particular, pixy facilitates these calculations using VCFs containing invariant sites, missing sites, and missing genotypes.
