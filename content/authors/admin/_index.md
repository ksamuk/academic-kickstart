<h4> I am an evolutionary geneticist fascinated by how [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination) shapes the process of evolution and the diversity of life. 

I tackle my research questions using a variety of tools, including population genomics, experimental evolution, and computer simulations.

I am also passionate about the positive role of computer software in reproducible scientific research and science education.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Mohamed Noor's lab at Duke University.

<p style="color:black;font-weight: bold">In July 2021, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology at the University of California, Riverside.
</br></br>
My research group will focus on the evolutionary genomics of adaptation and speciation, with a special interest in the role of recombination rate variation. 
</br></br>
Interested prospective PhD students and postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to contact me directly!</p>
